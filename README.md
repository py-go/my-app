# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Part1 : System Architecture

![Design](./aws.png "Design")

- API Gateway:
    - Easy integration with Http/Https endpoints.
    - Monitoring and throttling of connections 
    - Reduced Load on Lambda by filtering the request.
    - Custom Error Handling(400, 404, 405):

- Lambda API(Uploading the dataset to an S3 bucket):
    - Serverless API
    - Save extra cost of standby server
    - Auto Scale up/down as per load

- S3 Storage: 
    - High avilablity
    - Provides a fully redundant data storage infrastructure 
    - Cheap compared to Amazon Redshift


- AWS Glue(Pre-processing the dataset for training):
    - Pay per second model
    - Serverless ETL
    - Support reading/writing from GBs and TBs of data using S3

- SageMaker(Training and deploying the model):
    - AWS managed infra for ML Models
    - Build, train, and deploy machine learning 
    - Training and tuning ML models with limitless resources

## Part2: Working code, with optionally mocked data
![UI](./ui.png "UI")

- Captures auction information from prebid.js
- Adds auction data received from a javascript call to a persistent queue

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
